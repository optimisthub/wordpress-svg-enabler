== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can we change the allowed attributes and tags? =

Yes, this can be done using the `svg_allowed_attributes` and `svg_allowed_tags` filters. They take one argument that must be returned. 

`
    add_filter( 'optimisthub_svg_enabler_allowed_attributes', function ( $attributes ) 
    {
        $attributes[] = 'target'; // This would allow the target="" attribute.
        return $attributes;

    } );


    add_filter( 'optimisthub_svg_enabler_allowed_tags', function ( $tags ) 
    {
 
        $tags[] = 'use'; // This would allow the <use> element.

        return $tags;
    } );
